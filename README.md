## Overview

Crop prices are subject to unpredictable changes due to factors like climate, seasonal cycles, and market dynamics. This repository leverages machine learning algorithms, climate and market datasets, and data visualization to build a predictive model for crop prices. The project is an end-to-end solution, from data preprocessing to model training and deployment as a simple web or CLI app[^1][^2].

## Features

- Predict future crop prices based on location, weather, and historical price data
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, normalization, and encoding)
- Training and evaluation of various machine learning models
- Data visualization for exploratory analysis
- Deployment-ready code (e.g., Flask app or Jupyter notebook)[^1][^2]


## Installation

Before starting, ensure you have Python 3.7+:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AzimMohideen/Crop-Price-Prediction.git
cd Crop-Price-Prediction
```

2. **Install the required packages:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

You can use this project as a standalone script, Jupyter notebook, or web application (if implemented using Flask).

### Run Training and Evaluation

Edit the configuration or script to suit your dataset paths and feature choices.

```bash
python web_interface.py
```


### Web Application (if provided)

1. Start the server:

```bash
python web_interface.py
```

2. Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser.

## Project Structure

Below is a typical project structure for a crop price prediction repository. Adjust accordingly for your actual implementation.

```


## Datasets

- **Crop Prices Dataset:** Contains historical price data for various crops and regions.
- **Climate Dataset:** Includes monthly data for rainfall, temperature, etc.[^1][^2]
- **Other Features:** May include soil type, market demand, or additional relevant variables.

*Example dataset sources:*

- Government open data portals
- India Meteorological Department
- AGMARKNET, FAOSTAT, etc.


## Machine Learning Approach

- **Preprocessing:** Data type fixes, normalization, one-hot encoding, and visualization
- **Exploration:** Histograms, scatter plots, correlation matrices, etc.
- **Models:** Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest are commonly used for such tasks[^2][^3].
- **Evaluation:** Metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R²


## Results

The project aims to accurately forecast future crop prices. Visualization and trained models help users interpret predictions and potential market trends.
